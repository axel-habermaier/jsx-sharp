# JSX#

JSX# is an experimental cross compiler from TypeScript to C#, translating `type` definitions, module and function declarations, most kinds of statements and expressions as well as JSX.

It is implemented in TypeScript using the TypeScript compiler API. The goal was to gain a deeper understanding of how JSX works under the hood and how the performance compares between server-side React and the C# output of this tool. Spoiler alert: C# is around two orders of magnitude faster.

There probably is no production use case for JSX#.
